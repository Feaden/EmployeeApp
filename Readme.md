# EmployeeApp
This is the training project that I practice in Spring MVC, Hibernate, AOP.  For view pages I use JSP The site is built on the basis Tomcat. Database - MySQL.
The idea is quite simple - there is a list of employees in the database of some company. Each employee can be deleted or the previously entered information about him can be changed.\
You can also add a new worker. Of course, all changes made on the site will be reflected in the database.
After each action, a logging simulation is output to the console.
